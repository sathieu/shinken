 Upgrading Shinken 
===================



Upgrading From Previous Shinken Releases 
=========================================


See the :ref:`update page for that <update>`. Basically it's only about backuping and installing from a later git version.




Upgrading From Nagios 3.x 
==========================


Just install Shinken and start the arbiter with your Nagios configuration. That's all.
